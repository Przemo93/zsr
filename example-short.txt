            "The vendor's authoritative identification of the
            network management subsystem contained in the entity.
            This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises
            subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and
            unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is
            being managed.  For example, if vendor `Flintstones,
            Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242,
            it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1
            to its `Fred Router'."
